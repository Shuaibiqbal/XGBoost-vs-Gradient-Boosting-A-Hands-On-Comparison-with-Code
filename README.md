# XGBoost-vs-Gradient-Boosting-A-Hands-On-Comparison-with-Code
A practical guide comparing traditional Gradient Boosting and XGBoost using real datasets. This repo explains key limitations of Gradient Boosting and demonstrates how XGBoost overcomes them through faster training, regularization, and better scalability — all with clean, well-commented Python code.

This repository provides an in-depth, hands-on comparison between Gradient Boosting and XGBoost — one of the most powerful ensemble learning techniques in modern machine learning.

## 🔍 What You'll Learn:

* How Gradient Boosting works and where it struggles
* Key limitations of traditional Gradient Boosting (e.g., slow training, overfitting, lack of regularization)
* How XGBoost improves upon these limitations
* Code-based examples using scikit-learn and xgboost libraries
* Visual and metric-based comparisons on performance and training time
* Parameter tuning using GridSearchCV for both models

## 📈 Dataset Used:

sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer (or similar) – A clean, real-world binary classification dataset

## 🚀 Why XGBoost? XGBoost addresses major challenges in traditional boosting by offering:

* Parallel tree building for faster training
* Built-in regularization to reduce overfitting
* Native handling of missing data
* Better scalability on large datasets
